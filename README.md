# Ossification in COVID-19 Patients

## Overview
This repository contains code and data related to a research project that investigates the impact of COVID-19 on ossification in patients. Abnormal bone formation may have consequences for long-term health, and understanding the underlying molecular mechanisms is crucial.

## Files
- `DEA.R`: The R script for differential expression analysis.
- `DEA_results.csv`: CSV file containing the results of the differential expression analysis.
- `Netbio.cys`: A Cytoscape session file for the network analysis and modules' creation.
- `enrichment_GO.R`: R script for gene ontology enrichment analysis.
- `results_GO_1.csv`, `results_GO_2.csv`, `results_GO_4.csv`: CSV files with gene ontology enrichment results.

## Research Objectives
We aim to uncover how COVID-19 affects the molecular processes related to ossification. Our approach integrates network biology principles and transcriptomic data analysis to identify key genes and gene alterations associated with ossification in the context of COVID-19.

## Research Question
**Research Question:** How can we utilize COVID-19 patients' transcriptomic data to investigate active modules within an ossification network, to identify gene alterations and potential candidate genes associated with ossification-related complications during COVID-19 infection?

Feel free to explore the code and data in this repository to learn more about our research.
